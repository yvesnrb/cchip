This is an interpreter for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8][CHIP-8 programming language]]. Its
default behavior is to emulate the "quirks" present on the original
COSMAC VIP version of the interpreter, but switches are provided to
make use of ROMs made for other interpreters. The interpreter passes
all tests on the [[https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite][Timendus Test Suite]] for the original CHIP-8 target
(SUPER-CHIP and XO-CHIP are not supported). Sound, video and input are
supported via the [[https://www.libsdl.org][Simple DirectMedia Layer]].

This project was written for didactic purposes to learn about the C
programming language and graphics programming with SDL, I'm not
providing any binaries and the code is as-is.

The current build target is macOS on Apple Sillicon. There isn't
anything that should keep this from being compiled on/for Linux but I
haven't tried it yet.
